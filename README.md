 A school project about sorting hotels according to some characteristics. The optional criteria was to make a TKinter interface. TKinter is probably the reason for all of earth's infortune. So instead we made a webserver and a webapp, using the python script with child_process. Yes, we overengineered. No, we don't regret it.
