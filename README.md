# ExpressHot
 A school project about sorting hotels according to some characteristics. The optional criteria was to make a TKinter interface. TKinter is probably the reason for all of earth's misfortune. So instead we made a webserver and a webapp, using the python script with child_process. Yes, we overengineered. No, we don't regret it.

# Conclusion

This project was very informative.

But it also highlighted lots of shortcomings:
- we're not that good at teamworking yet
- we need to plan more
- functions need to be more separated

Still better than TKinter tho.
